During this laboratory you will invoke GCC tools in order to build a benchmark program. Additionally, you will learn to use the Make build system to automate this process. Once this has been completed, you will learn to use the GDB debugger and a Unix text editor (vim or emacs is recommended) to fix errors in the source code, as well as, watch a specific variable's value change throughout execution.
