HTML to LaTeX Conversion with Lex

lex files (.l) - 3 sections delimited by %%, include your includes at the top
	definitions 
	R.E rules and associate actions
		ex. "<h1>"[^<]*"</h1> {printf("Matched a header tag!");}
	subroutines (for example,a main function to print stuff)

	%x denotes states - we can enter states on certain matches, and write
	matches that only are valid in certain states.  x is for exclusive
	states, meaning global matches no longer apply

	Denote states by <statename> before the rule.  More than one can be
	included <state1, state2> rule {code action}

	REJECT lets us outright reject certain patterns

yytext is a built-in variable that points to the first charater matched, up to
the last character matched followed by a null terminator.
